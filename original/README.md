# Original English Chapters

This directory contains the original English source files for the book "Agentic Design Patterns," which serves as the reference for the Chinese translation project.

## 📚 About This Project

This is a Chinese translation project of the book "Agentic Design Patterns." The book systematically introduces various design patterns for AI Agent systems, covering 21 core patterns from basic to advanced levels, along with multiple appendices.

## 🎯 About the Book

"Agentic Design Patterns" explores the core design patterns for building intelligent AI Agent systems, including:

-   **Fundamental Patterns**: Prompt Chaining, Routing, and Parallelization
-   **Intermediate Patterns**: Reflection, Tool Use, and Planning
-   **Advanced Patterns**: Multi-Agent Collaboration, Memory Management, and Knowledge Retrieval
-   **Practical Patterns**: Guardrails/Safety Patterns, Evaluation, and Monitoring
